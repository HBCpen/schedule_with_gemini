# Gemini API-Powered Schedule Management Application

## Overview
This is a browser-based schedule management application designed for intuitive use. It leverages the Gemini API for advanced features, aiming to make schedule management more efficient and intelligent. Users receive email reminders for upcoming appointments.

## Key Features

### User Management
-   Account creation, login, and logout (basic email/password authentication).
-   Optional profile settings (name, timezone, etc.).

### Schedule Management
-   **Manual Entry:** Input title, start/end times, location, detailed notes, color-coded tags.
-   **Natural Language Input (via Gemini API):**
    -   Example: "Meeting with Mr. A in Shibuya tomorrow at 14:00, also set a reminder for document preparation."
    -   Gemini API interprets and suggests entries for date, time, location, attendees, content, and reminders.
    -   Users confirm/modify suggestions before saving.
-   **Event Display:**
    -   Calendar formats (monthly, weekly, daily).
    -   List format.
    -   Gemini API-powered summary (e.g., "You have 3 important events today: a morning meeting, an afternoon client visit, and an evening deadline for document submission.").
-   **Edit/Delete:** Intuitive modification and deletion of events.
-   **Recurring Events:** Settings for daily, weekly, monthly, yearly repetitions.
-   **Search:** Keyword, period, and tag-based event search.
-   **Sharing (Optional):** Share specific events with other users.

### Reminder Functions
-   **Email Reminders:** Notifications sent N minutes/hours/days before an event's start time, configurable by the user.
-   **Personalized Emails (via Gemini API):** Enhance reminder emails with information like weather forecasts or travel route suggestions.
-   **Browser Notifications (Optional):** Real-time alerts using Web Push API.

### Advanced Gemini API Features
-   **Automatic Tagging/Categorization:** Gemini API analyzes event content (e.g., "meeting," "dinner," "exercise") and suggests tags/categories.
-   **Free Time Search/Suggestion:**
    -   Natural language queries like, "What 2-hour slots are free next Monday afternoon?"
    -   Gemini API analyzes the calendar and presents available times.
    -   Assists in coordinating schedules for multiple participants (integrates with sharing).
-   **Related Information:**
    -   Based on event location, Gemini API provides weather forecasts, traffic information, nearby restaurant suggestions.
    -   Suggests news articles or documents related to event content (with user permission).
-   **Task Proposal/Breakdown:**
    -   For large events (e.g., "New Product Proposal Writing"), Gemini API suggests necessary sub-tasks (e.g., "market research," "competitor analysis," "draft creation") and helps register them as a To-Do list.
-   **Learning from Past Schedules:**
    -   Analyzes past schedule patterns to suggest automatic registration of routine work or recommend productive time slots (with privacy considerations).

## Screen Layout
-   **Login Screen:** Email and password fields, link to new user registration.
-   **Main Screen (Calendar View):**
    -   Header: App name, user icon (link to profile), logout button.
    -   Sidebar: Mini calendar, tag list/filter, Gemini API input field (for natural language event addition or search).
    -   Main Content Area: Monthly/weekly/daily calendar display, event listings.
    -   Add Event button.

-   **Event Detail Modal/Screen:** Confirmation of registered content, edit/delete buttons. Area for Gemini API-provided related information.
-   **Settings Screen:** Profile settings, notification settings (email address, reminder timing), timezone, data linkage settings (for future expansion).

## Proposed Technology Stack
-   **Frontend:** Modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular) for efficient UI development and component-based architecture.
-   **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (Express), Ruby on Rails, chosen for ease of Gemini API integration (Python SDK is comprehensive) and rich library support.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, selected based on schedule data characteristics (relational or document-oriented).
-   **Gemini API Integration:** Google AI Python SDK (or SDKs/REST API for other languages).
-   **Email Sending:** Email delivery services like SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, or a self-hosted SMTP server.
-   **Infrastructure:** Cloud platforms like Google Cloud (Firebase, App Engine, Cloud Functions), AWS, Azure for scalability and managed services.

## Considerations for Using Gemini API
-   **API Key Management:** Securely manage and protect API keys.
-   **Usage Costs:** Understand the API call-based pricing and design for budget-conscious operation.
-   **Response Time:** Consider API response speed and use asynchronous processing to avoid impacting user experience.
-   **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate fallback measures for API errors.
-   **Privacy:** Clearly define privacy policies for sending user event data to Gemini API and obtain user consent. Handle personal information with utmost care.
-   **Prompt Engineering:** Design effective prompts to get desired results from the Gemini API.

## Development Steps (Example)
1.  **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Definition and Development:**
    *   Implement core features: manual event addition/editing/deletion, calendar display, email reminders.
    *   Focus initial Gemini API integration on "natural language event addition."
2.  **Basic Feature Expansion:**
    *   Add search functionality, recurring event settings.
3.  **Gradual Addition of Gemini API Features:**
    *   Sequentially add free time search, automatic event tagging, related information display.
    *   Improve based on user feedback.
4.  **UI/UX Improvement:**
    *   Continuously enhance the user interface and user experience.
5.  **Optional Feature Consideration/Development:**
    *   Consider features like sharing or integration with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar).

## Other Considerations
-   **Security:** Implement basic web application security measures (XSS, CSRF protection, SQL injection countermeasures).
-   **Performance:** Optimize database design and queries for smooth operation even with large amounts of schedule data.
-   **UI/UX Design:** Aim for an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. Design Gemini API-integrated features for natural usability.
-   **Testing:** Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests appropriately to ensure quality.
