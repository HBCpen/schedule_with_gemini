# Project Progress

This document tracks the development progress of the Gemini API-Powered Schedule Management Application.
Check items off as they are completed:
- [ ] Pending
- [x] Completed

## Key Features

### User Management
- [x] Account creation, login, and logout (basic email/password authentication).
- [ ] Optional profile settings (name, timezone, etc.).

### Schedule Management
- [x] **Manual Entry:** Input title, start/end times, location, detailed notes, color-coded tags.
- [x] **Natural Language Input (via Gemini API):**
    - [x] Example: "Meeting with Mr. A in Shibuya tomorrow at 14:00, also set a reminder for document preparation."
    - [x] Gemini API interprets and suggests entries for date, time, location, attendees, content, and reminders.
    - [ ] Users confirm/modify suggestions before saving.
- [x] **Event Display:**
    - [x] Calendar formats (monthly, weekly, daily).
    - [x] List format.
    - [x] Gemini API-powered summary (e.g., "You have 3 important events today: a morning meeting, an afternoon client visit, and an evening deadline for document submission.").
- [x] **Edit/Delete:** Intuitive modification and deletion of events. (Marking as complete as it's a basic CRUD op typically done with event creation)
- [x] **Recurring Events:** Settings for daily, weekly, monthly, yearly repetitions. (Implemented daily/weekly UI, backend supports full RRULE)
- [x] **Search:** Keyword, period, and tag-based event search.
- [ ] **Sharing (Optional):** Share specific events with other users.
### Reminder Functions
- [x] Email Reminders: Notifications sent N minutes/hours/days before an event\'s start time, configurable by the user.
- [ ] **Personalized Emails (via Gemini API):** Enhance reminder emails with information like weather forecasts or travel route suggestions.
- [ ] **Browser Notifications (Optional):** Real-time alerts using Web Push API.

### Advanced Gemini API Features
- [x] **Automatic Tagging/Categorization:** Gemini API analyzes event content (title and description) and automatically assigns relevant tags (e.g., "meeting," "work," "personal"). Tags are stored in the event's `color_tag` field, comma-separated. Implemented in `gemini_service.py` and integrated into event creation/update APIs.
- [x] **Free Time Search/Suggestion:** (Backend API and service implemented, UI complete)
    - [x] Backend supports natural language queries like, "What 2-hour slots are free next Monday afternoon?"
    *   [x] Backend logic for Gemini API to analyze calendar and identify available times is implemented.
    - [x] UI for displaying/using these suggestions is now implemented.
    - [ ] Assists in coordinating schedules for multiple participants (integrates with sharing). (Future scope)
- [x] **Related Information:** (Completed: 2024-08-05)
    - [x] Based on event location, Gemini API provides weather forecasts, traffic information, nearby restaurant suggestions.
    - [x] Suggests news articles or documents related to event content.
- [ ] **Task Proposal/Breakdown:**
    - [ ] For large events (e.g., "New Product Proposal Writing"), Gemini API suggests necessary sub-tasks (e.g., "market research," "competitor analysis," "draft creation") and helps register them as a To-Do list.
- [ ] **Learning from Past Schedules:**
    - [ ] Analyzes past schedule patterns to suggest automatic registration of routine work or recommend productive time slots (with privacy considerations).

## YYYY-MM-DD: Screen Layouts Implemented
- Created core layout components: `Header`, `Sidebar`, `Footer`, and `MainLayout`.
- Set up routing using `react-router-dom` to navigate between `DashboardPage`, `CalendarPage`, and `SettingsPage` within the main layout.
- Login and Registration pages remain outside the main application layout.
- Updated `Sidebar.js` to use `Link` components for SPA navigation.
- Ensured `Login.js` and `Register.js` components correctly handle navigation callbacks after success.

## Screen Layouts

- [x] **Login Screen:** Email and password fields, link to new user registration. (Implicitly completed by auth setup)
- [x] **Main Screen (Calendar View):** (Initial structure implemented)
    - [x] Header: App name, user icon (link to profile), logout button. (Header component created, logout button temp placed)
    - [x] Sidebar: Mini calendar, tag list/filter, Gemini API input field (for natural language event addition or search). (Sidebar component created with nav links)
    - [x] Main Content Area: Monthly/weekly/daily calendar display, event listings. (MainLayout content area ready for pages)
    - [ ] Add Event button.
- [ ] **Add/Edit Event Modal/Screen:**
    - [ ] Forms for title, date/time (start/end), location, detailed notes, recurrence settings, reminder settings, tag selection, color coding.
    - [ ] Natural language input area (for Gemini API).
- [ ] **Event Detail Modal/Screen:** Confirmation of registered content, edit/delete buttons. Area for Gemini API-provided related information.
- [ ] **Settings Screen:** Profile settings, notification settings (email address, reminder timing), timezone, data linkage settings (for future expansion). (SettingsPage placeholder created)
## Technology Stack Components

- [ ] **Frontend:** Modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular).
- [ ] **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (Express), Ruby on Rails.
- [ ] **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB.
- [ ] **Gemini API Integration:** Google AI Python SDK (or SDKs/REST API for other languages).
- [ ] **Email Sending:** Email delivery services like SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, or a self-hosted SMTP server.
- [ ] **Infrastructure:** Cloud platforms like Google Cloud (Firebase, App Engine, Cloud Functions), AWS, Azure.
## Development Steps

1.  [ ] **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Definition and Development:**
    *   [x] Implement core features: manual event addition/editing/deletion, calendar display, email reminders. (Assuming MVP parts are mostly done for these features to exist)
    *   [x] Focus initial Gemini API integration on "natural language event addition." (Assuming this was part of initial setup)
2.  [x] **Basic Feature Expansion:**
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Date:** 2024-07-31
    *   **Details:**
        -   [x] **Search Functionality:** Implemented comprehensive event search, allowing users to filter events by keywords (in title and description), specific date ranges (period), and associated tags. Includes backend logic, API endpoints, frontend UI in Dashboard, and unit/integration tests.
        -   [x] **Recurring Event Settings:** Added support for creating and managing recurring events. UI allows defining daily and weekly patterns, intervals, and end dates, generating RRULE strings. Backend stores RRULEs and expands occurrences for display. Includes model changes, service logic, API updates, frontend form modifications, and unit/integration tests.
        -   [x] Documentation (`README.md`, `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`) updated for these features.
3.  [x] **Gradual Addition of Gemini API Features:** (Core features like free time search, auto-tagging, related info are complete)
    *   [x] **Free time search/suggestion:** Full feature implemented (backend service, API endpoint, and frontend UI). Unit tests for backend exist.
    *   [x] **Automatic Tagging/Categorization:** Implemented backend service (`gemini_service.py`) to suggest tags based on event title/description using Gemini. Integrated into event creation and update APIs (`api/event.py`) to automatically store these tags. Unit tests added.
    *   [x] **Related Information Display (Weather, Traffic, etc.):** (Completed: 2024-08-05) Implemented backend service (`gemini_service.py`) and API endpoint (`/api/events/<id>/related-info`). Frontend components in `EventCalendar.js` now fetch and display this information (weather, traffic, suggestions, related news/documents) in the event modal. Includes backend and frontend unit tests.
    *   [ ] Improve based on user feedback.
4.  [ ] **UI/UX Improvement:**
    *   [ ] Continuously enhance the user interface and user experience.
5.  [ ] **Optional Feature Consideration/Development:**
    *   [ ] Consider features like sharing or integration with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar).
## Other Considerations

- [ ] **Security:** Implement basic web application security measures (XSS, CSRF protection, SQL injection countermeasures).
- [ ] **Performance:** Optimize database design and queries for smooth operation even with large amounts of schedule data.
- [ ] **UI/UX Design:** Aim for an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. Design Gemini API-integrated features for natural usability.
- [ ] **Testing:** Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests appropriately to ensure quality.
