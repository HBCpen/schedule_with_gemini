    - [ ] Suggests news articles or documents related to event content (with user permission).
- [ ] **Task Proposal/Breakdown:**
    - [ ] For large events (e.g., "New Product Proposal Writing"), Gemini API suggests necessary sub-tasks (e.g., "market research," "competitor analysis," "draft creation") and helps register them as a To-Do list.
- [ ] **Learning from Past Schedules:**
    - [ ] Analyzes past schedule patterns to suggest automatic registration of routine work or recommend productive time slots (with privacy considerations).
## Screen Layouts

- [ ] **Login Screen:** Email and password fields, link to new user registration.
- [ ] **Main Screen (Calendar View):**
    - [ ] Header: App name, user icon (link to profile), logout button.
    - [ ] Sidebar: Mini calendar, tag list/filter, Gemini API input field (for natural language event addition or search).
    - [ ] Main Content Area: Monthly/weekly/daily calendar display, event listings.
    - [ ] Add Event button.

    - [ ] Forms for title, date/time (start/end), location, detailed notes, recurrence settings, reminder settings, tag selection, color coding.
    - [ ] Natural language input area (for Gemini API).
- [ ] **Event Detail Modal/Screen:** Confirmation of registered content, edit/delete buttons. Area for Gemini API-provided related information.
- [ ] **Settings Screen:** Profile settings, notification settings (email address, reminder timing), timezone, data linkage settings (for future expansion).
## Technology Stack Components

- [ ] **Frontend:** Modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular).
- [ ] **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (Express), Ruby on Rails.
- [ ] **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB.
- [ ] **Gemini API Integration:** Google AI Python SDK (or SDKs/REST API for other languages).
- [ ] **Email Sending:** Email delivery services like SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, or a self-hosted SMTP server.
- [ ] **Infrastructure:** Cloud platforms like Google Cloud (Firebase, App Engine, Cloud Functions), AWS, Azure.
## Development Steps

1.  [ ] **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Definition and Development:**
    *   [ ] Implement core features: manual event addition/editing/deletion, calendar display, email reminders.
    *   [ ] Focus initial Gemini API integration on "natural language event addition."
2.  [ ] **Basic Feature Expansion:**
    *   [ ] Add search functionality, recurring event settings.
3.  [ ] **Gradual Addition of Gemini API Features:**
    *   [ ] Sequentially add free time search, automatic event tagging, related information display.
    *   [ ] Improve based on user feedback.
4.  [ ] **UI/UX Improvement:**
    *   [ ] Continuously enhance the user interface and user experience.
5.  [ ] **Optional Feature Consideration/Development:**
    *   [ ] Consider features like sharing or integration with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar).
## Other Considerations

- [ ] **Security:** Implement basic web application security measures (XSS, CSRF protection, SQL injection countermeasures).
- [ ] **Performance:** Optimize database design and queries for smooth operation even with large amounts of schedule data.
- [ ] **UI/UX Design:** Aim for an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. Design Gemini API-integrated features for natural usability.
- [ ] **Testing:** Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests appropriately to ensure quality.
