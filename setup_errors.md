# Setup Process Summary and Observations

This document summarizes the setup process for the Gemini Scheduler application, including backend, frontend, and E2E tests.

## Overall Status

The core application (backend and frontend) was set up successfully and appears to be running. However, E2E tests could not be executed due to persistent timeout issues, likely related to the testing environment or interaction between the tests and the application.

## Backend Setup

-   **Status:** Successful.
-   **Process:**
    -   Installed Python dependencies from `gemini_scheduler_app/backend/requirements.txt`.
        -   **Observation:** Several system-level packages (`distro-info`, `gyp`, `python-apt`, `unattended-upgrades`) and their specific versions had to be removed from `requirements.txt` to enable successful installation in the environment. This suggests the `requirements.txt` might be tailored to a very specific OS/environment setup or contains packages not essential for the core application logic.
    -   Database migrations were run using `flask db upgrade`. Alembic (via Flask-Migrate) was used.
    -   The backend server (Flask application) was started using `flask run &`.
-   **Verification:**
    -   A `curl` request to the root (`/`) of the backend server resulted in a 404 Not Found, which is acceptable as not all applications serve content at the root.
    -   A `curl` request to a known API endpoint (`/api/events/summary`) resulted in `{"msg":"Missing Authorization Header"}`.
    -   **Observation:** This indicates the backend API is running and requires authorization, which is a normal and expected behavior for protected endpoints. No errors blocked the backend setup itself.

## Frontend Setup

-   **Status:** Successful.
-   **Process:**
    -   Installed Node.js dependencies from `gemini_scheduler_app/frontend/package.json` using `npm install`.
        -   **Observation:** The `npm install` process completed but showed several warnings related to deprecated packages and reported some vulnerabilities. These are common in Node.js projects and did not prevent the application from starting.
    -   The frontend development server (Create React App) was started using `npm start &`.
-   **Verification:**
    -   A `curl` request to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (the default React development server port) successfully retrieved the main HTML page.
    -   **Observation:** This confirms the frontend development server is running correctly. No errors blocked the frontend setup.

## E2E Test Execution

-   **Status:** Failed.
-   **Process:**
    -   Installed Node.js dependencies for E2E tests from `e2e_tests/package.json` using `npm install`. This step was successful.
    -   The `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable was set as instructed.
    -   Attempted to run Playwright tests using `npx playwright test` (as no specific script was found in `e2e_tests/package.json`).
-   **Errors/Observations:**
    -   **Persistent Timeouts:** The test execution consistently timed out after approximately 400 seconds (around 6 minutes and 40 seconds).
    -   This timeout occurred even when:
        -   Increasing Playwright's own timeout setting significantly (e.g., `--timeout=900000` for 15 minutes).
        -   Attempting to run only a single, presumably simple, test file (`tests/example.spec.js`).
    -   The backend and frontend servers were running during these attempts.
    -   **Conclusion:** The E2E tests could not be completed. The consistent timeout duration, irrespective of Playwright's timeout settings or the scope of tests being run, suggests a potential external limitation imposed by the testing environment itself, or a fundamental issue with the test setup's interaction with the application under test within this specific environment. Without more specific error messages from Playwright beyond the timeout, further diagnosis was not possible within the scope of the task.

This file summarizes the setup experience. The core application components (backend and frontend) are running, but automated E2E verification was not possible.
